            Personal Info
        </h2>

        <p>
            My name is Peter G. Morales, and I am a Silicon Alley software developer!
        </p>

        <p>
            Before I decided to change careers, I was working as an electrician. While I was in trade school, <br> I
            learned about something called, "Ladder Logic". What I found out (through research on my own) <br> is Ladder
            Logic
            is a type of programming language.
        </p>

        <p>
            Unlike C (or most other language), it's graphical, rather than textual. If you're familiar with <br>
            schematics or blueprints, it's kind-of like that. Along with some other aspects I learned, such <br> as
            where the construction industry was going, I decided to fully pursue a career in software <br> development. My
            short-term goal is to become competent in web development technologies. My <br> long-term goal is to become
            proficient in app technologies that work with Apple.
        </p>

        <p>
            What I learned in the trade school inspired me to research into software development. This <br> gave me the
            time to find out if this was "something I could handle". The connection I made <br> between electrical engineering
            and computer science made the learning of programming easier, <br> I think. And it gave me the confidence, and the hope,
            I needed.
